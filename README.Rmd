Porcelain helps convert R packages into easily-tested APIs, using [`plumber`](https://www.rplumber.io/).  The ideas come from our experience putting complex R APIs into production where it is important that the API behaves predictably even with unpredictable inputs.

The focus of `plumber` is quickly putting together applications and works like magic. In `porcelain` we take a more explicit approach defining standard response types and using [schemas](https://json-schema.org/) to make clear the API contract.

While a work-in-progress, we use this in several applications:

* [`orderly.server`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly.server) which asynchronously runs [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) reports
* [`hintr`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/hintr/) which runs statistical analysis of HIV prevalence under interventions (see [the project page](https://reside-ic.github.io/projects/naomi/) for more information).
* [`mintr`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/mintr) which is a simpler application looking at interventions for malaria control.  The application is [publicly available](https://mint.dide.ic.ac.uk/)
* [`cometr`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/cometr) which runs dynamic models of COVID-19

Each of these applications is used by web applications written in Kotlin/TypeScript - see [this poster](https://reside-ic.github.io/resources/RSLondonSE-hint-poster.pdf) for more on our design approach.
