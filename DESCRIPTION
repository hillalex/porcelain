Title: Turn a Package into an HTTP API
Version: 0.1.5
Authors@R: c(person("Rich", "FitzJohn", role = c("aut", "cre"),
                    email = "rich.fitzjohn@gmail.com"),
             person("Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine",
                    role = "cph"))
Description: Wrapper around the plumber package to turn a package into
    an HTTP API. This adds some conventions that we find useful, such as
    some testing infrastructure and automatic validation of responses
    against a json schema.
